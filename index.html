                I was born in San Jose, California, and I graduated from San Jose State University with a BS in Computer
                Engineering in 2018. My hobbies are cooking, baking, photography, 3D printing, playing video games, and
                travelling. My interests include making things with my hands, learning about different things, and
                having
                fun.
                <br>My favorite things to cook are:
                <ul>
                    <li>Spaghetti Carbonara</li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=904dG5l5AB8" target="_blank"

                </ul>
                My favorite things to bake are:

                    <li>Astrophotography</li>
                </ul>
                My dreams are being able to make anything I can imagine, to enjoy my time and have fun with my friends
                and
                family, and to taste all kinds of tasty food all around the world. My career goals are leading amazing
                projects
                that innovate quality of life for everyone; whether it's technology or products or interpersonal
                connections.
